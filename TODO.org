* create intermediate directory entries in object store for nested keys
* store archive with .tgz suffix
* clear output directories between task runs
* put commands in namespace
* store timestamp, sisyphus id in logs
* put Commands in the namespace like Processes
* almost always filter logs for a specific job (= user + timestamp); sometimes for a specific task within a job
* ensure that running a Command always begins without previous output files even if it reuses an open docker container
* rename 'key' to 'name'?
* unit tests
* test what happens when things go wrong. does it emit helpful error messages? can it do self-repair?
* use a docker image version tag? how to feed it to the workflow builder?
* auto-launch worker nodes
* ability to post a workflow directly from your desktop?
* tools to simplify and speed up the dev cycle
* implement nightly builds and PR builds
* clean up each workflow job when done
* obviate everyone needing a personal GCE VM
* optimization: reuse a running docker container when the previous task requested the same image
* optimization?: a separate set of nodes for each job
